# Am-Group
AM is a group that gathers each week to listen to Ambient Music for 1 hour. It takes place in the micro-studio at ITP-NYU. The idea of the poster I made was to use one piece of technology as an exploration tool for poster design creation. The first attempt (Fall 2016 ) was to use the Scanner.
The goal for Spring 2017 it to use websites as a medium for poster design.

Fall 2016 posters can be found here:
