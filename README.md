# Am-Group
Websites as a medium for poster design.
AM is a group to listening Ambient Music for 1 hour every week that takes place in the micro studio at ITP-NYU.
The idea of the poster is to use one type of a piece of technology to explore as a tool for poster design creation. The first attempt (Fall 2016 ) was to use the Scanner.

Fall 2016 posters can be found here:

* The goal for Spring 2017 it to use websites as a medium for poster design.
